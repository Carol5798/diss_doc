\section{Known Limitations and Future Work}\label{sec:fut_work}
% refine parameters in the vision module - optimal number of frames to obtain tracks and to prediction
% test in mmWaves
% test in better hardware?

%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Only predicts for one UE
%    \item Camera resolution needs to be at least 360p -- check
%    \item Camera FPS
%    \item Computational power limited. Could use other tracking solutions
%    \item Lighting condition
    
%\end{enumerate}


%FUTURE WORK - have 2 cameras in order to have depth information and extract (x,y,z) location of the obstacles and UEs. Scale the work for several UEs. Use interface E2 to communicate with the xApps.
